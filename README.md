# bug-facebook-profoundly

## Facebook profoundly bug 2019/3/9.
This bug allows you to view other people's messages, even an anonymous message through Profoundly, an anonymous ask & answer Facebook app.

## Update 2019/3/12: 
This bug is fixed by moving to another server and change the format of the JSON response. We can no longer see the sender but still can see all the messages ;)

## Update:
This bug is completely fixed by moving to another other server and use authentication token.
2019/4/18: I found the game deleted on facebook :D
